The first design/dev project ever. A simple gallery with HTML, CSS and MDBootstrap.

I had a difficult getting all the images to fit together, given their different resolutions, and making the gallery completely responsive.
I eventually decided on the MDBootstrap framework because of its image responsiveness. After a weekend of fighting with it, I finally achieved the desired result.
